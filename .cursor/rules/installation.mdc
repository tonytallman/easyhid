# Installation Requirements

## Single-Command Installation Rule

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** Installation must be a single click or a single command. The app must work for any Debian-based distribution after installation.

### Requirements

1. **Single Command Installation**
   - Users must be able to install with: `sudo apt install ./easyhid_*.deb`
   - All dependencies must be automatically resolved and installed
   - No manual dependency installation steps required

2. **Zero User Effort**
   - No manual `apt install` commands for dependencies
   - No manual group membership changes (handled by postinst)
   - No manual configuration files to edit
   - The only user action should be: install the .deb file

3. **Debian Compatibility**
   - Must work on all Debian-based distributions:
     - Debian 11+
     - Ubuntu 20.04+
     - Linux Mint 20+
     - Pop!_OS 20.04+
     - Elementary OS 6+
     - Any other Debian derivative

4. **Desktop Integration**
   - Application must appear in application menu
   - Users can launch by clicking the icon
   - No terminal required for normal usage

### Implementation Guidelines

- All system dependencies MUST be declared in `debian/control` under `Depends:`
- Post-installation scripts (`debian/postinst`) handle any setup that requires user context
- Desktop entry (`debian/easyhid.desktop`) provides GUI launcher
- Build process (`build-deb.sh`) creates a single distributable .deb file

### What NOT to Do

- ❌ Require users to run separate `apt install` commands
- ❌ Require users to manually add themselves to groups
- ❌ Require users to edit configuration files
- ❌ Require users to run setup scripts manually
- ❌ Create installation instructions with multiple steps

### What TO Do

- ✅ Create a .deb package with all dependencies declared
- ✅ Use postinst script for any post-install setup
- ✅ Provide desktop entry for easy launching
- ✅ Test that `sudo apt install ./easyhid_*.deb` installs everything needed

### Priority

This is a fundamental requirement. If installation cannot be made this simple, the project should be abandoned rather than requiring manual steps.
